## Front end coding test:

### Your task:

Use create-react-app to build a react application that matches at least the first 3 requirements, 4 and 5 are bonus.

1. Use any static file server ( such as https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to serve the data as a mock back end, you can also build one by yourself, but it will not be assessed as this coding test.

2. Create a view to display the data from your API as our wire frame shows.

3. Create a search component to allow the user to search for record in the "database" (only need to be client side)

4. Write some validation logic to validate the userâ€™s search input.

5. Have some sorting logic to sort the data display.

### Notes:

1. It must be a working application.

2. You can use any CSS libraries, but we prefer bootstrap 4.

3. To have unit test is a bonus, and you can only add one or two to demonstrate your skill is good enough.

4. Your code quality and your project structure will be the most important things to assessed in this coding test.
